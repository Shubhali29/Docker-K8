1. How the resource comsumption is monitored in K8s
2. Metrics like -
    - How many nodes are there
    - How many of them are healthy
    - What is CPU, memory and disk utilization
3. K8s does not provide montioring tool.
4. But there are various opensource monitoring tools like:
    - Metrics Server
    - Prometheus
    - Elastic Stack
    - Datadog
    - Dynatrace
5. There is one metric server per cluster.
6. Metric server is in memory monitoring tool. It does not have disk.
7. Metric server collectes metric data from nodes through cAdvisor component of kubelet.
8. After metric server deployment run below cmd to get the stats:
    - kubectl top node
    - kubectl top pod
9. To see logs in k8s use cmd
   -  kubectl logs <pod name>
